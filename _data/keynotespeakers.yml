Gravitating to Agile methods as a competitive advantage for software development at startups in the early 2000s, Andrew pioneered new ways of working to automate systems which evolved into practices that are now mainstream. While the tools and practices continue evolving, Andrew is still focused on helping organizations change their behavior to improve their technology outcomes."
