***Considering the ongoing international emergency regarding the COVID-19 Coronavirus, we are aware that an in-person conference may not be feasible. While we are moving forward with the planning of an in-person conference, there is a possibility we may need to make the conference virtual. We ask that you design content that could be effectively presented in either format. We will provide technical guidelines and assistance to speakers who may not be familiar with delivering virtual content should the decision be made to hold the conference virtually.***

### **Overview**
Application Security leaders, software engineers, and researchers from all over the world gather at Global AppSec conferences to drive visibility and evolution in the safety and security of the world’s software, as well as to network, collaborate, and share the newest innovations in the field.

The conference will take place at the **Hyatt Regency in San Francisco, California**. It will begin with training sessions from **October 19 - 21, 2020** and the main conference on **October 22 - 23**.

#### [**Call for Trainers (CfT)** is open](https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/162471/global-appsec-san-francisco-2020-cft)

The Program Team is formally issuing a call for Trainers, opening <b>March 23,  2020</b>. 

As with previous Global AppSec events, we would like to run a number of different training courses of varying lengths over the three days of the conference.

Trainers can apply to give 1, 2, or 3 day classes.  Multiple applications are allowed; one application per class. The training target audience will include developers interested in security as well as security professionals.

We are looking for world-class training courses applicable at all levels - from someone new to the application security field to advanced topics for experienced professionals. However, all training submissions should have a focus on practical skills which are immediately applicable to an attendee’s job.  The course should also have a significant hands-on element, with tasks and exercises to attempt during the training.
